### Week 1.2: How Computers Work

#### Framing
> “Before we can understand video games, we need to understand what kind of machine is even capable of running them.”

#### Core Concepts

##### 1. What a Computer Really Is
- A machine that follows instructions (programs)
- It does 3 main things:
  - **Input** – gets information from outside (keyboard, controller, camera)
  - **Processing** – follows instructions to decide what to do
  - **Output** – shows the result (screen, sound, controller vibration)

##### 2. Basic Components (Very High-Level)
- **CPU** – the “brain” (logic and decisions)
- **RAM** – short-term memory (fast but volatile)
- **Storage** – long-term memory (game data, saved files)
- **GPU** – graphics processor (renders images, animation)
- **Motherboard** – the central board everything connects to
- **Input devices** – controller, keyboard, mouse
- **Output devices** – monitor, speakers, haptics

##### 3. Binary and Logic (1–2 minutes)
- Everything in a computer is ultimately **1s and 0s** (on/off signals)
- Games, images, and music are just **patterns of binary data**
- Example: a sprite = a grid of pixels = a map of on/off values

##### 4. How This Relates to Games
- *Pong*: takes controller input → updates positions → redraws screen
- *Pac-Man*: checks joystick → moves character → tests collisions → updates visuals/sound
- Every game has some sort of **Game Loop**:

##### 5. Speed
- *Fast Memory is small and expensive*
- *Big Memory is slow*
- *Memory Matters*
- *CPU Speed matters too but memory most*
- *pre-calculation of things enables but requires memory*
